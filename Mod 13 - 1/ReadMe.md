# Description

- A chatbot for my NFL player page to ask the chatbot what team players play for so if that is what they want, they can ask it directly rather than scrolling for a long time
- I added the feature that when a player is added to the database, the chatbot also adds the question and answer for their team, college, and jersey number
- This allows the "bot" to learn as new players are added to the database
- Also works for their college and jersey number
